My name is Stefan Sundin. I am a university student in Sweden, programming my tools in my free time.

Donations are a great motivation for me to keep updating my programs. They are also perfect to get my attention if you want me to add some special feature.

You can get in touch with me by sending an email to `stefan(at)stefansundin.com`. You can also [http://stefansundin.com/ visit my website] to read a little more about me.

The easiest way to donate is by sending money with PayPal to `stefan(at)stefansundin.com`. You can donate with PayPal without a PayPal account, using only your credit card. Note that PayPal will take a small processing fee.
