= Introduction =

My name is Stefan Sundin. I am a student in Sweden, programming my tools in my free time. My programs will always remain free and open source, even if I receive no donations.
While you don't have to donate, donations are a great motivation for me to keep updating my programs. They are perfect to get my attention if you want me to add some special feature. :) But you should probably [mailto:recover89@gmail.com send me an email] first and ask if I can do it at all.

  * [mailto:onyxreyes@gmail.com Onyx Reyes]: Icons

Also thanks to everyone who have reported bugs.
