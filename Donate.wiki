= Introduction =

My name is Stefan Sundin. I am a student in Sweden, programming my tools in my free time. My programs will always remain free and open source, even if I receive no donations.

Donations are a great motivation for me to keep updating my programs. They are perfect to get my attention if you want me to add some special feature, but you should probably send me an email first and ask if I can do it at all.

You can get in touch with me by sending an email to [mailto:recover89@gmail.com recover89@gmail.com]. You can also [http://stefansundin.com/ visit my website] to read a little more about me.


= Who have contributed =

While I have done most of the work, here are some people who have contributed.

Also thanks to everyone who have reported bugs.


= How to donate =

The easiest way to donate is by sending money with PayPal to recover89@gmail.com. You can donate with PayPal without a PayPal account, using only your credit card. Note that PayPal will take a small processing fee.
